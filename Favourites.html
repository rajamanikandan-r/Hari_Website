        <p>
          Roblox is an online game platform and game creation system developed
          by Roblox Corporation that allows users to program and play games
          created by themselves or other users.
        </p>
        <p>
          At its core, Roblox is a gaming platform that allows you to play
          dozens of user-created games or create games through Roblox Studio.
          From role-playing games to rhythm titles and shooters, the platform is
          a toy box of experiences for all ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was founded by David Baszucki.I play a game called "Blox fruits" in
          Roblox because it is a game which refers to a animated series which I
          watched

    <h3>Minecraft</h3>
    <hr />

      <p>
        Minecraft is a game made up of blocks, creatures, and community. Blocks
        can be used to reshape the world or build fantastical creations.
        Creatures can be battled or befriended, depending on your playstyle.
        Experience epic adventures solo or with friends, there's no wrong way to
        play.I like it because of its difficult gameplay which I find
        challenging.

        <p>
          Brawl Stars is one of the most entertaining games currently available
          on smartphones. It's highly polished, but somehow lacks the heady
          compulsion that typified the early days of Clash Royale or Boom Beach,
          with rounds feeling less fun and exciting than the colourful cartoon
          characters that participate in them.It is owned by company which earns
          millions of dollar called "Supercell".
