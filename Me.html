      My name is Rajahariharan.I study 7th grade currently.My parents both work
      in the IT field.I like to play a lot of video games.My favourite subject
      is Math because it involves logical thinking and problem solving skills.I
      have a taste for the finer things
    </p>
    <p>
      I used to know HTML,CSS and Javascript.And very recently I started
      learning Python.I find coding very interesting because of the same reason
      why I like math. Math and Coding have a lot in common.
