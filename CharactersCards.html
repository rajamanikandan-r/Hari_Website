        <h2>Goku</h2>
        <p>
          Originally named Kakarrot' he was the son of Bardock, a low-class
          Saiyan warrior; and Gine, born on Planet Vegeta in or around Age 737.
          Sensing the impeding danger to the Saiyan race from Frieza, his
          parents secretly sent him off to earth when he was only three years
          old.

          Monkey D. Garp, who did many dangerous things to Luffy to make him
          stronger, like throwing him down a deep ravine, leaving him alone in
          the wild, and tying him to a balloon.

          improving his relaxation and control over his power.

        <h2>Gohan</h2>
        <p>
          As a child, Gohan was a shy, studious, intellectual child who lacked a
          Saiyan's raw fighting spirit, so he had to utilize his incredible
          half-breed Saiyan potential and emotional reserves to protect those he
          loves. As an adult, he achieves his dream career of becoming a great
          scholar.
